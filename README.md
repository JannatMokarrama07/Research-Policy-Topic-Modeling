<p align="justify">
This study explores the representation of youth in US policy documents by analyzing how research on youth topics
is cited within these policies. The research focuses on three key questions: </p>
 - Identifying the frequently discussed topics in youth research that receive citations in policy documents,
 - Discerning patterns in youth research that contribute to higher citation rates in policy, and
 - Comparing the alignment between topics in youth research and those in citing policy documents.

  Through this analysis, the study aims to shed light on the relationship between academic research and policy formulation, highlighting
  areas where youth issues are effectively integrated into policy and contributing to the broader goal of enhancing youth engagement in societal decision-making processes. </p>
