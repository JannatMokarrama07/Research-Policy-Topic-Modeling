# Research-Policy-Topic-Modeling
This study explores the representation of youth in
 US policy documents by analyzing how research on youth topics
 is cited within these policies. The research focuses on three key
 questions: identifying the frequently discussed topics in youth
 research that receive citations in policy documents, discerning
 patterns in youth research that contribute to higher citation
 rates in policy, and comparing the alignment between topics in
 youth research and those in citing policy documents. Through
 this analysis, the study aims to shed light on the relationship
 between academic research and policy formulation, highlighting
 areas where youth issues are effectively integrated into policy and
 contributing to the broader goal of enhancing youth engagement
 in societal decision-making processes.
